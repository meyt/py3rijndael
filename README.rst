py3rijndael
===========

Rijndael algorithm library for Python3.

Rijndael is the key algorithm of [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard),
and there is some of implementations already exist:

- [pycrypto](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto): Very old and not written in python.
- [pycryptodome](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome): In road of `pycrypto` but alive.
- [python-cryptoplus](https://github.com/doegox/python-cryptoplus):
Tested and works fine. but, not in Python 2, also depend on `pycrypto`.
- [RijndaelPbkdf](https://github.com/dsoprea/RijndaelPbkdf):
Tested and works fine. but, old PyPi release and not active (i have no time to wait for maintainer).
